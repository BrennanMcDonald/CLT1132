        "description": "In the early 1926, work began on the Rideau Canal, overseen by Lt. Colonel John By with the purpose of providing safe passage from Montreal to Kingston. It was estimated that 4,000 labourers would be required to build the engineering feat. While documents have been lost, one list exists that has the names of nearly 673 men, mostly Irish, who were working on the Canal. Standing approximately 3 feet tall, The Rideau Celtic Cross is located near Rideau Canalâ€™s lock 1, this stone cross is engraved with traditional Irish patterns. It was unveiled in 2004 as a memorial to the workers who died building the canal between 1826 and 1832. The Rideau Cross is significant to celtic culture in Canada because it stands to show the sacrifice of Celtic people in Canada as well as showing the enormous contribution they made to one of Canada's most prominent landmarks.",

        "description": "During the irish famine thousands of families immigrated to Canada from Ireland, while many survived the journey not everyone shared the same luck. During an outbreak of typhus in 1847, an estimated up to 18,000 Irish immigrants died attempting to reach Canada. In the mid 19th century a mass grave was unearthed containing the bodies of approximately 6,000 immigrants. In 1865, the Irish Commemorative Stone was created to honor the lives of those who did not survive the journey to Canada. Every year a walk is held from St Gabriel's church to the stone to commemorate those lost. The Irish Commemorative Stone is significant as it educates people on the hardships that Irish citizens went through to immigrate to Canada.",

The Chaffey's Lock Cemetery contains roughly 30 fieldstones that once had names but are now unreadable due to weather and the age of the stones. This cemetery specifically pertains to those who lost their lives in the settlement of Chaffey's Mills. The area was named after Samuel Chaffey, a businessman who moved from England to Upper Canada in 1816. Chaffey is most notable for his last mill which was dismantled to make way for a new lock on the Rideau Canal. The Chaffey's Lock Cemetery is imporant to celtic life in Canada as it is a reminder of sacrafice required to establish a thriving celtic population in Canada.",
