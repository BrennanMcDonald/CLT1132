                    <p>
                        Covid19 drastically changed my approach to this assignment, however, I don't believe that all the changes I made were negative. If it weren't for Covid-19 I would have stuck to a much more local set of locations as being able to visit them would have
                        been fascinating. Due to covid19, I was able to take a more cross-country approach to my locations and was able to learn about topics that I may not have if I focused on only local monuments. I would have also conducted interviews
                        to get more first party sources as the online sources were good but did occasionally did not convey the same message an interview would have.
